# 🏗 EventCatalog Studio

EventCatalog Studio is another tool by the [EventCatalog](https://eventcatalog.dev/) team. You can now use our tools to [document your architecture](https://eventcatalog.dev/), design concepts and ideas using Studio and embed them into your catalogs. 

EventCatalog Studio is the **next step in the EventCatalog journey** — a visual editor and collaboration tool to help teams **design, document, and govern event-driven or distributed architectures**.

With Studio, you’ll be able to:
- 🎨 **Visually model** your domains, services, and events  
- 📥 **Import/export** formats like AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and EventCatalog  
- 👥 **Collaborate** with your team on architecture drafts and designs  
- ☁️ **Use in the cloud or self-host** for full control

## 🚧 Current Status

EventCatalog Studio is in early access.

We are using this period of time to gather feedback, and make the project better.

EventCatalog Studio is **not open source yet**, but it’s on our [public roadmap](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/roadmap).  

The code will be published here once we’re ready to open it up (post early access). Stay tuned!
